# C-Projects

As of now there are five projects in this repository, with each file being a console application.
The repository will only contain console apps, any web apps can instead be found in their 
own repositories. This will help me with organization (as well as being a personal preference).

## Files:
* Calculator App
* Coffee Order App
* Counting Sheep App (based on the phrase "Counting Sheep to Sleep")
* Null Cipher Decoding and Encoding App (specifically encoding into a grocery list)
* To Do List App

The projects that are added to this repository all generate output. Some are in progress.
The Null Cipher has a slight issue with the decoding portion. Otherwise, I'm especially fond 
of the Coffee Order App. But I enjoy the To-Do List app- a fun way to play with calling methods.

## In Progress...
* The next project to be added in this console app category should be a small tip calculator.

BTW...A new repository will be added for my C# web apps.
