# C-Projects

As of now there are four projects in this repository, each file is a console application.
The repository will only contain console apps, any web apps can instead be found in their 
own repositories. This will help me with organization.

## Files:
* Calculator App
* Coffee Order App
* Counting Sheep App (based on the phrase "Counting Sheep to Sleep")
* Null Cipher Decoding and Encoding App (specifically encoding into a grocery list)

The projects that are added to this repository all generate output. Some are in progress.
Like the current newest addition, Null Cipher; has a slight issue with the decoding portion.
Otherwise, I'm especially fond of the Coffee Order App.
